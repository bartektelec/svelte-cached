## Install

```sh
npm install svelte-cached
```

## Usage

```ts
import { cached } from 'svelte-cached';
```

Set the initial value for the store.
To keep the store in sync with it's source, provide a retrieve async function as the second argument.

TTL is set as third argument, if not provided you will need to manually call `store.retrieve()` function whenever you want to sync the state.

```ts
const getLatestBitcoinPrice = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(...);
  // ...
  return price;
};

// get a fresh price every 5 seconds
const btcPrice = cached(0, getLatestBitcoinPrice, 5000);
```

Use the cached store instance just like any other Svelte store.

```svelte
<p>Current BTC price:{$btcPrice}</p>
```
